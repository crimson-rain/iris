**Intelligent Response and Interaction System (IRIS)** is a system used to generate emergent, dynamic, and contextually aware interactions for NPCs using LLMs. 
It aims to move beyond static, pre-written lines by allowing NPCs to respond dynamically and adapt their interactions with the player based on player choices, 
world events, and character personalities.
