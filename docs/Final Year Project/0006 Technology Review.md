## Introduction
This technology review evaluates tools and technologies relevant to developing emergent dialogue and quest generation in RPGs (Role-Playing Games) using LLMs. Selecting the right technology for this project is critical to the success of the project, as it will directly affect time management and the iterations of the project; Such as the rapid prototyping phase. The primary goal of this project is to create a game where players can interact with NPCs to learn more about the world through dialogue, while also receiving dynamic and context-driven quests generated by the large language model. To achieve these objectives, the chosen technologies must support rapid development, ensure consistency, and enable seamless integration of new features and updates.
## Game Engine

### Godot (GDScript)
**Benefits**
- Lightweight and Open Source
- Ideal for 2D Games but has options for 3D games.
- Extensive community support and tutorials for indie developers
- Built-in scripting language (GDScript) facilitates quick prototyping.
**Limitations**
- Performance can be suboptimal for large-scale 3D games.
- Smaller community compared to Unreal Engine.

Godot offers a lightweight, open-source game engine curated for indie developers. The engine is primarily suited for 2D game development but provides solid ground for 3D Games. Because of Godot's open-source and simple-to-learn identity, it has garnered a community committed to producing content and guides for the game engine.

The Godot engine also comes with its own scripting language, GDScript, which is a Python-like programming language specifically built for the Godot engine. Because of GDScript's simplicity, it allows for quick game prototyping while also meeting game performance demands.

3. [Road to Vostok](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1963610/Road_to_Vostok/)



### Unreal Engine (Blueprint)
**Benefits**
- High-fidelity rendering capabilities for immersive visuals
- Visual scripting Blueprint simplifies logic creation for non-programmers.
- Large library of pre-built assets and plugins
**Limitations**
- Steep learning curve
- Resource-intensive; requires high-performance hardware.

Unreal Engine is a highly regarded and widely used game engine in the gaming industry. It excels in high visual fidelity, with its out-of-the-world immersion. Unreal Engine is more suited for AAA developers and large teams. Unreal Engine primarily attracts game developers who want to make games which have cutting-edge graphics and are generally large-scale projects.

Unreal Engine, like Godot, includes its programming language called Blueprint.
Blueprint is a visual programming language which is designed for ease of use and accessibility for developers who may not have a strong programming background. Unreal Engine also supports C++ directly out of the box when developers require more control and functionality. Unreal allows developers to use these two programming languages interchangeably.

**Games Developed in Unreal Engine**

## Programming Language

### Rust
**Benefits**
- Memory safety without a garbage collector
- High performance for backend systems game logic.
- Strong community focus on correctness and reliability.
**Limitations**
- Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with low-level programming
- Smaller ecosystem compared to C++.

Rust is generally a new programming language often seen as a modern version of C/C++. Rust excels in memory-safe and high-performance code. 

Rust is a general-purpose system-level programming language that excels in areas that require low-level control. Rust excels in memory safety and high-performance projects. This is due to the unique nature of the programming language, as it breaks many traditional features of various programming languages.

Rust emphasises memory safety with a strict ownership system and borrows a checker. This allows the prevention of null pointers dangling references, and data races at compile time. Through this system, rust can guarantee memory safety.

Rust has also adopted a modern syntax style, and has many benefits such as fearless concurrency as its ownership and borrow checker provide a built-in safety for this style of programming. 

**Some Companies That Have Adopted Rust**
- Microsoft
- Figma
- Discord
- Amazon

One limitation of rust is its steep learning curve, these are caused by the borrow checker and ownership model. The rust ecosystem is growing rapidly but isn't as mature as the C/C++ ecosystem as it's been around for decades. Some C/C++ libraries may not have a rust equivalent yet. Rust also introduces long compilation time, this is caused by its extensive safety checks and optimizations. Rust also has comparable performance to C++, and focuses on zero-cost abstractions, meaning things like safety don't incur runtime overhead.

**Language Features**
- No Raw Pointers in Safe code
- Relies on Ownership, Borrowing and Lifetimes
- Pattern Matching, An Expressive `match` statement
- Crates and Packages Ecosystem behind the Cargo Package Manager which is modern and user-friendly.

### C/C++
**Benefits**
- Widely used in game development, particularly for Unreal Engine.
- Established libraries and frameworks for gaming and AI.
- Flexibility and extensive tooling.
**Limitation**
- Prone to memory management errors.
- Longer development times compared to higher-level languages.


C/C++ is another high-level general-purpose programming language. C++ is the superset of C and follows the object-orientated paradigm. C++ allows manual memory management using keywords such as new and delete or using smart pointers. But this system increases the vulnerability of memory leaks, dangling pointers and data races unless the programmer takes explicit precautions to avoid these problems.

C/C++ is an easier language to get started but is much harder to master due to undefined behaviours and complexity in managing memory and low-level operations. 

**Language Feature**
- Extensive support for low-level programming using raw pointers and direct hardware interaction.
- Has a rich and complex feature set, including templates, multiple inheritance and polymorphism.
- Package management using tools such as Conan and vcpkg but isn't integrated or standardized as Rust's Cargo.

## LLM Technologies

### Ollama
**Benefits**
- Easy integration with existing Projects.
- Focuses on secure and privacy-conscious AI deployment.
**Limitation**
- Limited scalability for highly complex models.

Ollama is an open-source project which serves as a powerful and user-friendly platform for running LLMs on local machines. Ollama allows users to run open-source LLMs such as Llama, Qwen, Mistral and many more free and locally on a user's machine.

How Does Ollama Work?
Ollama bundles all the model information into a single package which is defined by a Modelfile.

Ollama will be used in this project to have local access to LLM APIs while avoiding API costs and also allowing the configuration of the LLM later if need be.

The benefits of Using Ollama are
- Enhanced Privacy and Data Security
- No Reliance on Cloud Services
- Customization and Flexibility
- Offline Access
- Cost Savings

### LangChain
**Benefits**
- Designed specifically for building AI-powered applications.
- Robust support for prompt engineering and memory management.
**Limitations**
- Can have a steep learning curve for developers who are new to AI.

LangChain is a software framework which allows the integration of large language models into applications. LangChain use cases largely overlap with document analysis and summarization, chatbots and code analysis. 

LangChain provides a centralized development environment which allows developers to manipulate various data structures, model chaining, and integrate external models and applications with external data sources, while also allowing them to break down issues into smaller sub-tasks.
### HuggingFace
**Benefits**
- Access to pre-trained models for NLP tasks.
- Strong community support and extensive documentation.
- Flexibility to fine-tune Models
**Limitations**
- Require significant computational resources for large-scale deployments.

Similar to Ollama, HuggingFace provides a platform to create and browse AI models. 
HuggingFace is an open-source data science and machine learning platform, and acts like a hub for people working in the field of AI and Machine Learning<sub>[3]</sub>.

## Version Control and Collaboration Tools

### Git
Git is another open source software, primarily as a version control system which helps developers keep track of changes in their code and project. Git is designed to be fast and performant. It is widely adopted by developers and is simple to use. 
### GitHub
As shown above, we use Git to keep track of changes and edits in the project, but we want to store those changes somewhere, this is where GitHub comes into play. GitHub provides a platform to store, share and collaborate code. It also allows the user to track and manage changes, get feedback and use some exclusive features inside of GitHub such as,
- GitHub Project for Project management
- GitHub Wiki for Knowledge Bases for projects
- Bug Tracking

GitHub is used by millions of developers worldwide to collaborate and design products used by everyone.
## Journaling and Knowledge Base
### GitHub Wiki
GitHub Wiki is a place to host documentation for a given project, allowing developers to write notes and host alongside the documentation.

The purpose of GitHub Wiki is to share long-form content about the project, such as how to use, install and how it was designed and its core principles and philosophies. 
### Obsidian
For my final year project, I will keep random notes and information in my Obsidian Vault. Obsidian is a note-taking app which helps users organize thoughts and knowledge. 

I will primarily use Obsidian to write and draw designs and journal my activities for my final year project. Drafts and Documentation can also be found in the Obsidian Vault.

## Diagramming and Visual Design
### Excalidraw
Excalidraw is a free and open-source diagramming software, used for basic diagrams, if more advanced shapes and diagrams are required, users can install packages. Excalidraw is easily interactable on Obsidian, which is why I'll be using this to draw my diagrams. 


### Draw.io
Draw.io is another free and open-source option, this has been stable for me when for this degree. Using it to draw things such as Flow Charts Entity Relation Diagrams and many other diagrams, this software has all the tools required to make well-made diagrams, but is somewhat dated.
