# Assets and Resources
Today I added some assets which I had bought off itch.io. The author of this bundle is named Gif. Link to the bundle [Super Retro World](https://gif-superretroworld.itch.io/) 

This bundle provides high quality resources, and provides all assets which is required for this game. 

To upload and merge such a large amount of assets into GitHub, I had to setup LFS also known as Large File System. Git LFS is used to handle and manage large binary files. This allows the uploading and management of these large binaries. When you push a LFS type file to GitHub it will completely overwrite the file instead of checking for the difference. 

After setting up Git LFS I have uploaded the Files and Assets which I will be using for my Project.

To comply with the authors wishes he suggests that users encrypt or lock the assets safely. Currently I have privatized my repository, if the repository ever goes public I will encrypt the assets to ensure they do not get stolen.
