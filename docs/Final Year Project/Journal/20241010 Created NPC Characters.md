Most of today was a lot of boiler plate, duplicate and copy and paste. 
I created very basic NPCs, I needed a simple way to lay the structure of the NPCs.
So I decided to create NPCs based of my friends [Baldur's Gate 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3) Characters.

Here are some funny descriptions of the characters I came up with.

### Aiden the Knight
A Knight of the Town of Aether.

### Jamie the Rogue
A Rogue...
### Laurentiu the Mayor
Overworked and Consistently Tired, is taking care of the entire town bureaucracy by himself. Burning hatred for Squirrels and all rodent adjacent life. Random fits of anger mid-sentence, rambling about some stupid government body

### Mel the Bard
A charismatic and flirtatious bard.
### Nedas
TBD
### Tobi
TBD
### Zee
TBD
