Previously implemented basic player movement in this file [[20241008 Created Player Character]].

Updated the player movement to be more smooth, and more readable. I also broke down the function for the player movement, and moved the code which handles the player movement into function called `movement`. Also implemented the movement for the player which is found in the `Player.gd` file, in the function `update_animation`.
