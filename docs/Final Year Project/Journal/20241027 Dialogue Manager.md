Started the Implementation of a Dialogue Manager in Rust.
This will generate and manage dialogue for the NPC. 

This stage is mainly to test everything is correctly integrated. 
LLM -> Rust -> Godot.

After the completion of the rapid prototyping phase of my project, I should consider implementing strict unit tests for both rust and Godot while also implementing integration test. This should be discussed in my testing documentation.
