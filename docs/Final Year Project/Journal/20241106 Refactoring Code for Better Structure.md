Refactoring the the API files for better readability, I'm still not happy with the systems architecture so I want to work on this on a later date, where I have more features implemented. This also means I have to implement best practices in rust as well as its philosophies of idiomatic programming. I'm also not making full use pattern Matching. I'll read through more rust repository to better grasp the language.
