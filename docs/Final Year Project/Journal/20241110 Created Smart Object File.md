## Log
#### Research on Smart Objects
Started research on smart objects and how I could make use of them inside the game.
The idea was given by Rogerio (Supervisor). He suggested using smart objects to store description and information's about objects.

Examples of Smart Object
**Book** - You can read a book by opening it, as well as close the book itself.
You maybe want to throw the book, or you want to discard it somewhere or give it to another person.

All these details and actions you can do with the book would be stored directly within the book.

#### Created Smart Objects File
Created a new file for smart objects, as a placeholder.
