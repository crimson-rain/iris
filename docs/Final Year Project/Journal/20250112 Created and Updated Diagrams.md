Today I updated the High Level System Architecture for the Game.

![[System Architecture Diagram]]

Shown in the Image above. This system architecture is based of the current implementations.

I have also created and designed the iterative design cycle for rapid development and prototyping. After rapid development phase of the project is done it will focus on polishing and refactoring the code such that it meets demands and fix any technical debts found in the code.

![[Iterative Design Cycle]]

Also started to write up my Literature review, I will be missing a paper. 
I'll also be starting my methodology, I'll need references for methodology and understand how I should write them as to ensure that it is high quality, and contains specific information. 

I've also spent the day contemplating where my gameplay should approach. I will be spending time creating an RPG world. As to flesh out the world.

I've also recognized some room for improvement such as brain-storming world design as well as making more use of GitHub's project management tools. I want to deeply integrate GitHub's project management tools to my workflow. 

I've also recognized that my workflow has been impacted as I'm not producing the output I'm required this is primarily because of other coursework's taking priority. As my time has to be spread out to other projects as well as my personal life. I will spend the first couple of weeks to catch up and complete the next milestone before the due date. During this time I will refactor my whole repository, from the game to the actual LLM system.

I will also be adding more technologies and tools which I haven't mentioned earlier. For example I will be adding GDUnit to test Godot Functions.

I've also spent sometime to better understand and develop knowledge of Rust as well as work on my fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms.
