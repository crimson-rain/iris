## Summary  
*Overhauled High Level Architecture Diagram and Added Iterative Design Diagram.*

---
## Log
#### Overhauled High Level Architecture
Updated High Level Architecture Design which represents the whole system. Currently separated into two key areas. The game and the rust library. 

![[System Architecture Diagram]]

The above image shows the system architecture and shows things which are currently implemented into the game project, one which isn't is the vector store. This will be worked on a later date, when all the key features are implemented.

#### Created Iterative Design Diagram
Created two iterative design diagrams, which will continuously implement features. 
Two iterative cycles are used for this project. One for my rapid development phase to show a somewhat finished product and another one which will have the full product implemented.

The key difference between these two diagrams are that the final prototype has additional steps and such as analysis and design as well as when testing it isn't just testing if the feature works but also adding test cases for each feature themselves. 

In the final prototype phase there will be more metrics used to evaluate how well the feature is implemented.
