Today marks 90 days remaining. In my opinion, I feel like I could put much more effort in to making an amazing product, and research. I felt like I've been through a thing worse than tutorial hell and that's research hell. Because of how new large language models are still, there isn't really many libraries or tools which I can use to make the ease of development easy. 

I'm not complaining of course this means I'll have to find and understand more things. For example a problem which I was stuck on for quite some time was implementing RAG with Ollama. I'll need to read some documentation and understand how RAG actually works and I'll have to implement it.

For the next couple of weeks I want to focus on something other than brainlessly researching and that is to actually start creating the game. I've decided that I will create a simple RPG game, where the player can explore a finite world. There will be one or two dungeons can that the player can enter and fight monsters.

I think having a good framework for an RPG is important as a good framework for the game would allow me to have a clearer vision on implementation into the game.
For now I will make a basic RPG framework for the game. After completing the framework for the game I will flesh out the Dialogue and Quest Framework for the Game, such that the LLM can be fed all the information it needs to generate quests for the player.

I'll most likely combine three of the papers I found and create a system which can be meta-controlled by the LLM to do tasks.

On another note NVIDIA just announced its new AI Model. NVIDIA Ace, which is curated for gameplay, the model has been published to Ollama and I've experimented with it, it's fast, but still inconsistent, I believe I'll just need to give the LLM a large amount of context.
