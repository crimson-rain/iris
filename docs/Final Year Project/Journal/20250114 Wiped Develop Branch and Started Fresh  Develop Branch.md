## Additional Context
A lot of things were learnt during the rapid prototype phase of the project such as using threads. The structure of the project became very messy, disorganized and tedious to navigate. This occurred to as a result of over-abstraction. To many sub directories created for a single file, rather than creating just a single file which would represent the content.

A great amount of experience was achieved in this phase. Research helped with the understanding of key concepts and gain important insights and implementing them into code helped with mental models and understanding how different components would interact with each other.

Understanding more about threading and creating multi-threaded applications. In operating systems we learnt about threads and multi-threaded applications understanding why some software's go about this and why they use it.

The rapid prototype phase was much more of a feasibility test and a tracer development to see how the idea would work, and understanding the trade offs for implementing the project in a certain way.
