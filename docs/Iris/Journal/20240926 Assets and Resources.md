## Summary  
*Added assets and resources for the game. Importing it into Godot.*

---
## Log
#### Obtaining Assets and Resources
Imported game assets used which contains sprites and atlas' for the game.
The assets were obtained from this bundle named [Super Retro World](https://gif-superretroworld.itch.io/).

#### Setting up LFS to Store Assets and Resources
LFS also known as Large File System is primarily used to store large files which would be resource intensive to store in a regular VCS. LFS enables us to store these large files with the down side of not being able to look at the diff as LFS completely overwrites the file.

## Additional Information
To ensure that this project meets the authors wishes, he asks for users to encrypt or lock the asset safely when publishing the game. I'm meeting this demand by pirating the repository. Only allowing me and my supervisor to access the resources.
